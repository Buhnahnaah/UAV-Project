## Instructions for building a quadcopter

Firstly, we need to consider the components that required to complete a drone:
1. Flight controller (used Arduino UNO in this project)
2. Frame
3. Battery
4. ESCs
5. DC Motors
6. Power distribution board
7. Propellers
8. Gyroscope (MPU-6050)
9. Radio controller
10. Wires

(Be ware that DON'T put propellers on if you are not sure what are you doing !!!)
